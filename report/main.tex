\begin{abstract}
The purpose of this thesis is to implement and explain a number of screen-space global illumination methods. In order to achieve this goal I employ a deep G-buffer which provides our screen-space geometric data with an additional layer to allow for more scene consistency. I start out by going through the theory behind deferred rendering and its advantages, and use that to explain the advantages and use of a deep G-buffer implementation. I also explain the theory behind an omni-directional shadow map implementation based on a cube map texture produced in a single pass. I provide the theory for radiosity by taking a point of departure in the rendering equation and arriving at a quasi-Monte Carlo based screen-space solution. Additionally I explain the Alchemy SSAO algorithm and a filtering method to even out the results of both SSAO and radiosity.

I describe the implementation of all concepts mentioned under theory by using code samples before moving on to my results. Based on the quality and running times of the results I conclude that the deep G-buffer, for the purpose of the scenes used in this thesis, does not provide enough advantages to justify its extra cost. I consider the implementation of all concepts successful, but radiosity and the omni-directional shadow map need optimisations to be viable. The use of the depth buffer to reconstruct the scene is concluded to be a viable way to trade off a small amount of performance to potentially free up a lot of space from the G-buffer.
